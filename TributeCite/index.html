        <h1>Hagi's Biggest Moment</h1>
        <p>Hagi is famous for his talent and skill that he brought to the Romanian culture. He was very talented and started playing professionally at the age of 17. He inspired loads of children, including my father to have a love for the game of soccer. With that many generations of people across the globe play soccer and have a passion fo soccer but it is rare for someone to have such talent in the game. Hagi scored a phenominal goal from 30yards out bringing his team to a victory. He was a true model and showed people that you should never give up on the things you do and that nothing is done completely until time has run out.</p>
