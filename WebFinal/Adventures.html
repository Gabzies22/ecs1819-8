        Photo #1 was taken in Romania on our way to a small town called Săpânța. This was also near the border of Ukraine and Romania slightly up north and a river breaks the two countries into seperate locations. Photo #2 was taken at Yellowstone when we were on our way to my sister's graduation in California. I would for sure go there again because we didn't even explore half of the whole national park. Photo #3 was taken at Lake Tahoe in California where we wore shorts and short sleeves without knowing that the temp could drop to 30 degrees there.

     These 3 photos are with my closest guy friends who have taught me a lot even if I hadn't known them for as long. The first photo includes my friends since day 1 of school and I don't think I'd be who I am without them. They mostly don't do much but make me laugh and somehow enjoy life even when I don't feel like it's the greatest. So much appreciation for these lads.
